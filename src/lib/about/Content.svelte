  <h1>about</h1>
  <p>my name is tate, and  i have been  an amatuer programmer for a few years. i do not really consider myself to be very good at it, but i know enough to make this website.</p>
  <h2>little about me</h2>
  <p>i am currently a high school student in tennessee. i began my programming journey a while ago. i started when i wanted to learn how to create minecraft mods. i still never have learned how to. my hobbies nowadays mostly feature video games, guitar, and researching.</p>
  <h2>little about the site</h2>
  <p>this site was created using svelte. i programmed it on stackblitz because my school computer can't have npm or vite. i tried to make it kind of reminiscient of older websites from before i was alive.</p>
